          <span>
            Keyboards for real nerds â€” split in half so you can position them to
            match your shoulder width and wrist angle. The keys are arranged in
            a collinear layout, making it ergonomic all the way down to your
            fingertips, helping you avoid future medical issues.</span
          ><br />
          <span>
            The keyboard shown in the image is a "Corne" keyboard with 42 keys.
            It uses layers similar to the Shift key to access additional keys
            not visible on the surface. By keeping the layout compact, every key
            is no more than one unit away, making touch typing effortless.
