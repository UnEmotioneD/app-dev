            hardest distros to install.</span
          >
          <br />
          <span
            >Also it uses the package manager called "Pacman" which has a lot of
            packages or "programs" available in latest version</span

            too use as much of display space as possible.</span

          <br />
          <span
            >By default it will maximize a single window and if there is more
            then one it will arrange windows like tiles.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span
            >Also you can configure it too have gaps between windows and at the
            outer edge too make it look cooler or nerdier.

          <br />
          <span
            >And with something called workspace user can assign certain
            application to specific workspace which makes going to a app's

          <span
            >Which you can customize such as font, color or opacity of the
            background and that kind of customization makes working with the
            terminal so much better. Specially when working with Unix or Linux
            machines since there is a lot of times you can or should use the
            terminal.</span
          >
          <br />
          <span
            >Additionally with kitty you can view images directly from terminal
            and supports ligautre, a nice quality of life improvements which
            can't be done with other terminals such as iterm2 or Alacritty. And
            a feature that I really like is a cursor-trail effect kind of like
            cursor-trail on the Windows since you don't use mouse on
            terminal.</span

            into panes. </span

          <span
            >Which means you can open up more then one terminal in a single
            instance of terminal. For example if you open up live-server to view
            a HTML file and have a need to go to some other directories with
            TMUX just open new session, window or a pane, do some work there,
            come back to where you've just left it.
          </span>
          <br /><span
            >In my case more specifically. I open python file with NeoVim at the
            pane on the left and run nodemon(a terminal application that can run
            a program when change is detected). So whenever I update the python
            scripts and save the changes I can see what happened on the right
            side of the pane. Nice and convenient.</span

            something go into "Insert mode" with i key. To change the word with
            the cursor in it? use "ciw" which you can take it as "Change Inside
